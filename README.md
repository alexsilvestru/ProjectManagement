# Questions for the team

1. Q: Should we have an authentication feature from the first version of the application.
   A: Yes, there should be an authentication feature for users.
2. Q: Should there be a simple comment section for each project or would it be better to have tickets for each project in order to better visualize the tasks in each project?
   
   A: It would be really nice to be able to create tickets for each project and the comments can be linked to each ticket.
3. Q: How many statuses do we want to be available?
   
   A: We can start with three, for example: pending, in progress and done. We can think if we need any other statuses in time.
4. Q: Should the users only see their projects and tickets or should they be able to see all of them.
   
   A: In the first phase let's keep it simple and let everyone see everything and we can update the user's visibility and access rights later.
